# Fitness-HealthCalculators
# In this project, I decided to recreate all of the calculators from https://www.runtastic.com/blog/en/health-fitness-calculators/ using Python. 
# At this point, I have re-created the BMI, Daily Water Intake, Protein Calculator, Carb Calculator, Heart Rate Calculator, Basal Metabolic Rate,and Total Daily Expenditure Calculators.
# Next, I would like to add a Body Fat Calculator, and then bring all of these together to make the code more efficient.
# Down the line, I would like to implement HTML and turn this project into a webpage, or even better, an application, to increase usability.
